# Spec changelog

Class A spec fixes: an internal contradiction, an unresolvable section
reference, a type name that changed, a false claim about a dependency's API,
an example that does not compile. The loop fixes these itself and records
them here; they are reviewed in batch, after the fact
(`design/loops.md` section 6).

Anything that trades something off is Class B and belongs in
`state/decisions/`, not here.

Each entry quotes the contradiction and states the resolution. Newest last.

## 2026-08-02 — bootstrap — `loops.md` decision-record paths

Section 6 says an escalation is `state/decisions/NNN.md`; section 13 says
`state/decisions/<owner>-NNN.md` and argues for the prefix explicitly: "a
bare incrementing id is exactly the kind of thing that looks fine until two
sessions allocate `007` four seconds apart."

Resolved toward section 13, which is the one with the reasoning attached, and
section 6 updated to match. The code tag follows the file name and is now
`// DECISION-<owner>-NNN: provisional`. `grep -r DECISION-` still works as
the outstanding-provisional-choice report.

Recorded here rather than as a decision because there is nothing to trade: the
two sections cannot both be right, and only one of them says why.
