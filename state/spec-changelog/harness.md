# Spec changelog — harness

Class A spec fixes made by the harness loop, in the shape
`design/loops.md` section 6 asks for. Anything that trades something off is
Class B and belongs in `state/decisions/`, not here.

**An entry is provisional until a human reads it.**

## CHANGE-harness-001 — loops.md#4-the-iteration-contract — the tests step names `hj selftest` as well as `cargo nextest`

**Contradiction:** section 4 says the gate's steps are "all mandatory" and
lists `cargo nextest run -p <owned crates>` as the test step. Section 13 and
section 18 together create a loop that owns no crate — this one, whose
`crates` list in `state/phase.toml` is empty and whose deliverable is
`harness/`. For that loop the first three steps all print `skipped`, so a
gate that is "all mandatory" executes not one line of the code being changed.

The two claims are consistent only if the harness is not code, and it is:
`hj` computes `sections_clean`, the gap ledger, the cost rows and the scope
check. Section 19 lists "the loop rewrites the spec toward what it built" as
the failure with the thinnest defence; a loop that can silently break the
instrument computing its own number is the same failure with no defence at
all.

**Resolution:** the test step is now `cargo nextest run -p <owned crates>`
*and* `hj selftest`, the latter unconditionally. This trades nothing off:
the check is additive, it is hermetic (in-memory fixtures, no repository
state, no network), it costs about half a second, and no existing check is
weakened or narrowed. The alternative readings both cost something — leaving
it out keeps a loop unchecked, and making it conditional on owning no crate
would mean the check that guards the shared tool does not run on the gate of
the loop most likely to be affected by them breaking.

`hj selftest` is 19 checks over the parsing and arithmetic this campaign
added: cost-row merging, the experiment mix, audit-interval attribution,
spend attribution across phases and languages, budget scopes, and the
adapter's reading of the stream. Each was verified to fail under a mutation
of the code it covers, rather than only to pass.

**Declared, per the loop prompt:** this campaign edited a design document and
the code that document describes, in the same run. The document edit is one
bullet in section 4's gate list and it *widens* what the gate demands; the
campaign's three other commits are in `harness/` and are described by
section 15, which was not edited. `hj campaign-close` will flag the run
regardless, and it should — the declaration is here so the flag has an
answer next to it rather than an archaeology exercise.
