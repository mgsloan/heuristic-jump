* Avoid premature optimization - implement the slow simple version
  first to check if the idea works. Only after its validated worry
  about efficiency.

* Once an idea has been validated, use all the tricks you can to make
  it blazing fast. SIMD, etc. Ask me if you want to add more caching /
  indexing.

* Do not write unit tests. Instead everything will be covered via
  integration tests (the overall metrics) and property/fuzz tests.

* Use the newtype pattern frequently. Typically primitive fields
  should be appropriate newtypes.

* Instead of a mechanism like `anyhow`, use a single system-wide
  exception enum.

* Do not add doc comments to functions where their purpose and
  behavior is obvious. Only document things that are non-obvious or
  complex. Think relying on the external md files (and referencing
  those), and/or having a few central spots with more lengthy prose.

* Push allocations to the call site; avoid intermediate collections
  (accumulator-first recursion) — directly relevant to a latency-budgeted
  parser.

* Avoid monomorphization on crate boundaries (prefer &dyn/&Path over impl
  AsRef<Path>) to keep compile times down.

* Express preconditions in types; push control flow to the caller ("push ifs up
  and fors down").

* Prefer using enums to enforce invariants where possible instead of documenting
  invariatns

* Doc comments use full sentences, capitalized, ending in a period. Regular
  comments can be fragments for concision

# General rust coding hygiene

* Do not use wildcard imports

* Use `cargo fmt`

* Use `cargo clippy` - should pass for every commit

# Rust coding guidelines (from Zed)

* Prioritize code correctness and clarity. Speed and efficiency are secondary priorities unless otherwise specified.
* Do not write organizational or comments that summarize the code. Comments should only be written in order to explain "why" the code is written in some way in the case there is a reason that is tricky / non-obvious.
* Prefer implementing functionality in existing files unless it is a new logical component. Avoid creating many small files.
* Avoid using functions that panic like `unwrap()`, instead use mechanisms like `?` to propagate errors.
* Be careful with operations like indexing which may panic if the indexes are out of bounds.
* Never silently discard errors with `let _ =` on fallible operations. Always handle errors appropriately:
  - Propagate errors with `?` when the calling function should handle them
  - Use `.log_err()` or similar when you need to ignore errors but want visibility
  - Use explicit error handling with `match` or `if let Err(...)` when you need custom logic
  - Example: avoid `let _ = client.request(...).await?;` - use `client.request(...).await?;` instead
* When implementing async operations that may fail, ensure errors propagate to the UI layer so users get meaningful feedback.
* Never create files with `mod.rs` paths - prefer `src/some_module.rs` instead of `src/some_module/mod.rs`.
* When creating new crates, prefer specifying the library root path in `Cargo.toml` using `[lib] path = "...rs"` instead of the default `lib.rs`, to maintain consistent and descriptive naming (e.g., `gpui.rs` or `main.rs`).
* Avoid creative additions unless explicitly requested
* Use full words for variable names (no abbreviations like "q" for "queue")
* Use variable shadowing to scope clones in async contexts for clarity, minimizing the lifetime of borrowed references.
  Example:
  ```rust
  executor.spawn({
      let task_ran = task_ran.clone();
      async move {
          *task_ran.borrow_mut() = true;
      }
  });
  ```

# Rules Hygiene

These `.rules` files are read by every agent session. Keep them high-signal.

## After any agentic session
If you discover a non-obvious pattern that would help future sessions, include a **"Suggested .rules additions"** heading in your PR description with the proposed text. Do **not** edit `.rules` inline during normal feature/fix work. Reviewers decide what gets merged.

## High bar for new rules
Editing or clarifying existing rules is always welcome. New rules must meet **all three** criteria:
1. **Non-obvious** — someone familiar with the codebase would still get it wrong without the rule.
2. **Repeatedly encountered** — it came up more than once (multiple hits in one session counts).
3. **Specific enough to act on** — a concrete instruction, not a vague principle.

Rules that apply to a single crate belong in that crate's own `.rules` file, not the repo root.

## What NOT to put in `.rules`
Avoid architectural descriptions of a crate (module layout, data flow, key types). These go stale fast and the agent can gather them by reading the code. Rules should be **traps to avoid**, not **maps to follow**.

## No drive-by additions
Rules emerge from validated patterns, not one-off observations. The workflow is:
1. Agent notes a pattern during a session.
2. Team validates the pattern in code review.
3. A dedicated commit adds the rule with context on *why* it exists.
